# Aviva plc: Scalable and Secure MLOps Platform on AWS

## 📘 Project Overview
This mini project explores a real-world business case study in the insurance industry, focusing on **Aviva plc** and its adoption of **AWS cloud services** to modernize and scale its machine learning (ML) operations.  
The project analyzes Aviva’s use of the **AWS Enterprise MLOps Framework** to automate model deployment, improve governance, and enhance operational efficiency — demonstrating how cloud-based MLOps can transform business outcomes in large-scale organizations.

## 🏢 Case Study Summary
Aviva plc, a leading multinational insurer, faced challenges with manual ML model deployment and limited scalability. To address these issues, the company implemented a **fully automated MLOps architecture** using **Amazon SageMaker**, supported by CI/CD pipelines and multi-account isolation (Development, Staging, Production).  
This new infrastructure enabled Aviva to:
- Deploy hundreds of ML use cases rapidly and consistently.  
- Reduce infrastructure costs by up to **90%**.  
- Improve claims handling efficiency and model performance monitoring.
